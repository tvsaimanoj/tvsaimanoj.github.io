{"name":"Shivaram Venkataraman","tagline":"","body":"### About me\r\nI am a second year graduate student in the Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley. I am a part of the AMPLab and I am advised by Ion Stoica and Mike Franklin.\r\n\r\nMy research interests are centered around the design of storage systems and analytics platforms for big-data applications.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, I completed my Masters at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and worked in the Systems Research Group, under the guidance of Prof. Roy Campbell.  Before that I worked as a Software Engineer at Google in Bangalore for three years and I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n#### Refereed Publications\r\n\r\nAndrew Wang, Shivaram Venkataraman, Sara Alspaugh, Ion Stoica, and Randy Katz Cake: Enabling High-level SLOs on Shared Storage Systems - 3rd ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC 2012)\r\n\r\nShivaram Venkataraman, Indrajit Roy, Alvin AuYoung, and Robert S.
